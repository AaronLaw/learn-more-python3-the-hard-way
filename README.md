# Readme

This is a long-running project that I will go to (re)implement some UNIX commands with a book "Learn more Python the hard way" to learn to program better.

3 things to be bear in mind:
1. process
2. creativity
3. quality

## Quick hacks

Organization: program comments should be put in README rather than be put in the python script.

## Dealing with command line arguments

- [ ] on research how to get command line arguments from a user
    - [x] with `sys.argv`
    - [x] with `argparse`
    - [ ] with `click`

## cat
